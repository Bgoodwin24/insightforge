# Security Policy

This is a learning/portfolio project implementing security best practices. While care has been taken to implement security features, additional measures would be needed for production use.

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & User Management
- Password requirements enforced (minimum 8 characters, requiring uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters)
- Email validation for registration
- Rate limiting on registration attempts (maximum 10 attempts per IP address within a 15 minute window)
- Security event logging for failed registration attempts

### Data Protection
- Passwords are hashed before storage (not stored in plaintext)
- Input validation on all user-provided data
- Protection includes: Password security, Brute Force Protection, Rate Limiting, Input Validation, Security Logging, and Account Lockout after multiple failed login attempts

### API Security
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Authentication required for protected endpoints

## Security Enhancements Needed if Used in Production
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.)
- Implement distributed rate limiting (redis/database-backend)
- Add browser fingerprinting for more sophisticated attack prevention
- Add two-factor authentication option
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Implement HTTPS with proper certificate management
- Session timeout and forced re-authentication for sensitive operations

### Dependency Management
- Regular updates of all dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
- Automated dependency scanning

### Compliance
- Work toward compliance with industry security standards
- Commitment to user data privacy and protection

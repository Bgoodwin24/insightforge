# Security Policy
This is a learning/portfolio project implementing security best practices.

While care has been taken to implement strong security features, additional controls would be needed for production deployment.

## Security Measures Implemented
### Authentication & User Management
- Password requirements enforced (minimum 8 characters, requiring uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters)

- Email validation and verification using secure magic links

- Verification tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies (prevents JavaScript access to tokens, protecting against XSS). Secure flag is configurable and should be enabled in production.

- Rate limiting on registration attempts (maximum 10 attempts per IP address within a 15-minute window)

- Security event logging for failed registration attempts

### Data Protection
- Passwords are hashed using a secure algorithm before storage (never stored in plaintext)

- Input validation enforced on all user-provided data

- Measures include: password security, brute-force protection, rate limiting, input validation, security logging, and account lockout after repeated login failures

### API Security
- Input validation enforced on all API endpoints

- Rate limiting to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks

- Authentication required for all protected endpoints

- Use of HTTP-only cookies for storing sensitive tokens (e.g., email verification), reducing risk of token theft via XSS

## Security Enhancements Needed for Production
- Harden protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.)

- Implement distributed rate limiting using Redis or another backend

- Add browser fingerprinting or device profiling for advanced threat mitigation

- Implement optional two-factor authentication (2FA)

- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing

- Enforce HTTPS with proper TLS certificate management

### Dependency Management
- Keep all dependencies up to date to patch known vulnerabilities

- Use automated dependency scanning tools

### Compliance
- Work toward alignment with security best practices and industry standards

- Commit to responsible handling of user data and privacy
